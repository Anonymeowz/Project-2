<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>
    As a cat owner, I felt compelled to create a website so that I could share images of my precious with the world, whether they like it or not.
    Fortunately we only allow your friends to share their pictures with you.
</p>

<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>
    Who you choose to accept as your friend is up to you, but be warned that people can share photos of anything...
    Not all strangers share the love we have for our furry felines and as such we urge you to accept friends resposibly.
    We take no responsibility for any damages caused by the images you receive, neither physical nor emotional.
